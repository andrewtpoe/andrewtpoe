# TODO: Build a blog

I've had a personal website up for some time now, but it was really basic. Just
a landing page with a brief bio and some work experience. As a software
engineer, I was kind of embarassed by it. A personal site should be a
demonstration of my capabilities, not a boring letter.

_My personal site needed lots work._

Counter to that, I'm really busy. I work for a wonderful company, I have a
growing family, and I have lots of other projects calling for my attention. All
that to say, reworking my site was more of a "want" than a "need".

## Defining requirements

- As an engineer:

  - I need a site that can be built quickly and be easy to maintain.
  - I need a modern tech stack that will demonstrate my skills.

- As an author of content:
  - I need a site that is easy to write content for.
  - I need a site that looks appealing for my readers.
  - I need a site that is easy to navigate.
