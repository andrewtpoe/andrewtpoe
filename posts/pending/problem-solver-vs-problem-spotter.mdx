# Be a problem solver, not a problem spotter

_OUTLINE_

- You may have heard of the 80/20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principle. 80%
  of the output is the result of 20% of the input.
- Most people are excellent at spotting things that are out of place, incorrect,
  or need attention. Most people are not inclined or incentivized to fix
  problems.
- The world needs more people fixing problems, not finding them.
