# Ergonomics

I am in my early 30's. I've been a software engineer working from home for about
5 years. Until recently I have not paid proper attention to ergonomics, and I am
starting to realize just how big of a mistake that was. In just a few short
years I've developed new ways that I am in pain. Now I am gradually working to
receive treatment for that pain and correct the ergonomics of my workstation.

I hope my story helps you realize that you should not wait until you are in pain
to pay attention to ergonomics. I thought I was tough and it was silly to think
that a matter of a few inches in where I placed my elbow could affect me so
much. I was very wrong.

## In the beginning

A little back story might help. Before I became a software engineer I was an
automotive technician. Auto techs have lots of concerns when it comes to lifting
heavy objects, smashing fingers under wrenches, and dropping engines on your
head. They do not have many concerns at all related to sitting in a chair and
staring at screens all day. I have been extremely fortunate in my software
engineering career and have only ever had remote work. I've never spent a day
working in a cubicle, and have never had the benefit of an ergonomically
designed workspace. I've also never received training on the importance of
ergonomics in an office setting.

When I first made the career jump, the desk I had was (literally) a piece of
pre-fab countertop sitting across two old filing cabinets. It was very ugly, but
also very functional. I had a many year old Office Depot executive style office
chair that was nearly impossible to sit in for more than 2 hours without your
legs going numb. This combination of ugly but mostly functional office furniture
served me well enough for about 3 years, but also led me to many hours of
working from a couch or kitchen table.

I have been fortunate in my career to have always had a MacBook Pro to do my
work on. The machine is well made and a real pleasure to work with. As with all
laptops though, it has a small form factor that can lead to generally bad
posture.

## Pain in the neck

I routinely suffer from 3 primary kinds of pain:

- At some point in my career as an auto mechanic I did something that has caused
  chronic pain in my mid-back. I'm not sure what I did, and I don't have a
  diagnosis for what is causing the pain.
- I am prone to developing wrist pain, especially when typing on a small laptop
  keyboard for extended periods of time. I love the cleanliness of the small
  form factor, but my wrists do not.
- I routinely get severe neck pain, especially when I work primarily from my
  laptop and spend a lot of time looking down.

The last of these is likely the most significant. As the pain in my neck got
progressively worse and got triggered more often, I began to realize just how
poorly set up my office space was. This led me to both seek treatment for my
current pain _and_ make long overdue changes to my work area.

## Pain is not a lifestyle

About two years ago I began physical therapy and chiropractic care from a local
team of practioners. There slogan is "Pain is not a lifestyle". The treatments
have been incredibly helpful for immediate relief and general prevention of
pain. I continue to receive ongoing treatment and don't plan to stop any time
soon.
