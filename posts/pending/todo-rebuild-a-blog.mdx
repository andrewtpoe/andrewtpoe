# TODO: (Re)build a blog

This website has been a blog for only a few months, and only has a few articles
on it. When I built it, I used Gatsby. Why in the world would I spend the energy
to rebuild the site so soon?

One word: _simplicity_

I'm rebuilding this little blog of mine in Next.js because I find using Next.js
to be more simple. Simple, powerful technology makes me happy.

## Core Differences

Gatsby and Next.js are both static site generator frameworks that accomplish
roughly the same goals. They both have great developers working on the projects.
They approach the task of static site generation in fundamentally different ways
though.

Gatsby builds a data layer over your file system, and allows you to query your
files with GraphQL. This is a super neat approach, but adds a tremendous amount
of complexity to building or modifying a project. You must learn the data layer,
how to modify what goes in it, how to debug various aspect if something isn't
working as expected, etc... All of this knowledge is exclusively tied to Gatsby.

Next.js has a comparatively small API surface area. There are really only a
small handful of commands/ exports available for building an application.
Instead of building a custom data layer, it relies on the developer to navigate
the file system and query for data independently. In my own opinion, this is a
dramatically simpler approach.

## Developer experience

Next.js has what I feel is an absolutely incredible developer experience. When
using Next.js, it feels like the entire focus of the project was on developer
experience. Fast refresh really is lighting fast. Need TypeScript in your
project? That takes about 3 seconds to set up. When I need a tool I just reach
for it and it pretty much works as I expected.

Gatsby feels like they've taken a little bit of a different (not bad) approach.
When I need a tool I reach for a plugin. I then try to make the new plugin work
with the rest of my setup. Both tools have support for most everything I need,
Gatsby always just feels a bit more "fiddly".

## Summary

Both Gastby and Next.js are powerful tools and will work for nearly any static
site project. Using Next.js makes me happy though. Since this is my own site, I
want it to make me happy. It's really no more complex than that...
